        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Isaac and I'm passionately interested in Software
          Development.
          <br />I have spent time in various careers that includes Civil
          Service, Administration and Education, but I am determined to switch
          careers to this one. I love the combination of creativity and
          problem-solving that comes with building websites. I have always been
          fascinated by technology, and software development will allow me to
          bring ideas to life on the internet.
          <br />
          I am even more excited with the recent development in Artificial
          Intelligence and Machine Learning. and I will really like to dig deep
          into this.
          <br />
          I am married and blessed with three wonderful kids, and outside my day
          job, I am also a Pastor in my church in Hackney. My hobbies include
          listening to classical music, afro-gospel and nice reggae. I also like
          running, doing at least three 5kms a week.

        <h1>My Career Aspirations</h1>
        <p>
          I want to pursue a career as a software developer because I believe it
          offers endless opportunities for growth and innovation. ICT is
          constantly evolving, and being a part of this dynamic field excites
          me. Especially, with the advent of AI. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript, and I'm eager to continue learning and expanding my
          skills.
